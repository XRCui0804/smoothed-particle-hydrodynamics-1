# smoothed-particle-hydrodynamics
An implementation of the smoothed particle hydrodynamics based on the Philip Mocz's paper

Please read Philip Mocz's paper here:  
https://pmocz.github.io/manuscripts/pmocz_sph.pdf  

Although the paper stated MATLAB implementation, I can only find the Python implementation in his Github repository:  
https://github.com/pmocz/sph-python


These are some examples in this repository:  

Example 1:  
Free-falling Universitas Pertamina's logo

Example 2:  
Free-falling particles arranged in a grid formation

Example 3:  
More free-falling particles also arranged in a grid formation  ;-)

Example 4:  
Waaayy more free-falling particles also arranged in a grid formation  ;-) ;-)
